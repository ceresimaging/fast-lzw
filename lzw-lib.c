/* This library implements the LZW general-purpose data compression algorithm.
 * The algorithm was originally described as a hardware implementation by
 * Terry Welsh here:
 *
 *   Welch, T.A. “A Technique for High-Performance Data Compression.”
 *   IEEE Computer 17,6 (June 1984), pp. 8-19.
 *
 * Since then there have been enumerable refinements and variations on the
 * basic technique, and this implementation is no different. The target of
 * the present implementation is embedded systems, and so emphasis was placed
 * on simplicity, fast execution, and minimal RAM usage.
 *
 * The symbols are stored in adjusted binary, which provides considerably
 * better compression performance with virtually no speed penalty compared to
 * the fixed sizes normally used. To ensure good performance on data with
 * varying characteristics (like executable images) the encoder resets as
 * soon as the dictionary is full. Also, worst-case performance is limited
 * to about 8% inflation by catching poor performance and forcing an early
 * reset before longer symbols are sent.
 *
 * The maximum symbol size is configurable on the encode side (from 9 bits
 * to 12 bits) and determines the RAM footprint required by both sides and,
 * to a large extent, the compression performance. This information is
 * communicated to the decoder in the first stream byte so that it can
 * allocate accordingly. The RAM requirements are as follows:
 *
 *    maximum    encoder RAM   decoder RAM
 *  symbol size  requirement   requirement
 * -----------------------------------------
 *     9-bit     1792 bytes    1024 bytes
 *    10-bit     4352 bytes    3072 bytes
 *    11-bit     9472 bytes    7168 bytes
 *    12-bit     19712 bytes   15360 bytes
 * 
 * This implementation uses malloc(), but obviously an embedded version could
 * use static arrays instead if desired (assuming that the maxbits was
 * controlled outside).

#define NULL_CODE       -1      // indicates a NULL prefix
#define CLEAR_CODE      256     // code to flush dictionary and restart decoder
#define FIRST_STRING    257     // code of first dictionary string

/* This macro writes the adjusted-binary symbol "code" given the maximum
 * symbol "maxcode". A macro is used here just to avoid the duplication in
 * the lzw_compress() function. The idea is that if "maxcode" is not one
 * less than a power of two (which it rarely will be) then this code can
 * often send fewer bits that would be required with a fixed-sized code.
 *
 * For example, the first code we send will have a "maxcode" of 257, so
 * every "code" would normally consume 9 bits. But with adjusted binary we
 * can actually represent any code from 0 to 253 with just 8 bits -- only
 * the 4 codes from 254 to 257 take 9 bits.
